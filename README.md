## Statistics and EDA Project: ENEM 2019

This project aims to perform statistical tests and analysis on a dataset of ENEM 2019 using a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook contains exploratory data analysis and data preparation, which were necessary to perform the statistical tests.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is about ENEM 2019, which contains data on high school students' performance on the exam in Brazil. The dataset has several variables that describe the students' personal and academic characteristics, as well as their performance on the exam.

### Tasks
The tasks completed in this project include:

* Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploring the dataset by looking at the distribution of variables, identifying missing values, and detecting outliers.
* Data Preparation: Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values and outliers, and transforming variables as necessary.
* Hypothesis Testing: Performing hypothesis tests to draw some analysis and conclusions from the data.
* Correlation Analysis: Examining the correlation between some variables and addressing the concept of correlation vs causation.
* Linear Regression: Using linear regression to support the previous idea and make different types of predictions.


### Keywords
* Statistics: The science of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data.
* EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis, the process of summarizing and visualizing data to gain insights and understanding.
* Data Preparation: The process of cleaning and transforming data to make it suitable for analysis.
* Hypothesis Test: A statistical test used to determine if there is enough evidence in a sample of data to infer that a certain condition is true for the population from which the sample was drawn.
* t-test: A statistical test used to compare the means of two groups.
* Correlation: A statistical measure that describes the strength of the relationship between two variables.
* Causation: The relationship between an event (the cause) and a second event (the effect), where the second event is a result of the first.
* Linear Regression: A statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
